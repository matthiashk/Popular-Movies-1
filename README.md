Note:  
Please change the value for "API_KEY" in MainActivity before running
the program.

Description:  
The Popular Movies App, Stage 1 uses the api from www.themoviedb.org to
get a list of movies and display them in a grid to the user. The app allows
a user to select a movie from the grid and view information such as the
movie release date, user rating, plot synopsis and more. The user can also
choose the sort order from a settings menu and the app will display the
new sort order to the user. The app uses the Picasso library for displaying
images.
